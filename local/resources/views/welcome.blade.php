				   <p>
				   Thank you for considering us as the provider of your childâ€™s care and early education.
				   We offer early years provision for children of 2 to 4 years, ahead of their 
				   admission to Primary School. Jakeman Early Years Centre accommodates both daycare 
				   (children of 2-3 years) and a Birmingham Local Authority Maintained Nursery School 
				   (children of 3-4 years). Both provisions are run by a shared leadership team of fully
				   qualified teachers (QTS) and early years professionals.
				   We pride ourselves on offering a welcoming, happy, safe and stimulating environment 
				   for you and your child. Each age group benefits from purpose built premises and 
				   extensive outdoor grounds, in which children can grow, play and learn together.
				   We typically draw children from the Balsall Heath, Edgbaston, Harborne, Moseley 
				   and surrounding areas of South and Central Birmingham. Please feel free to contact us
				   to discuss your requirements or to arrange a visit.
				   </P>
